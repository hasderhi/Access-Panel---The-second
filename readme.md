## Introduction

### One of my first Python projects when I started programming was a simple "Keypad" that unlocked when the correct PIN was entered. Recently, I stumbled across that old code, and while it was fun to look back on, it was also pretty painful to read — overcomplicated, inefficient, and hard to follow. So, I decided to rebuild it from scratch using what I’ve learned since then, with cleaner and more modern Python code.
